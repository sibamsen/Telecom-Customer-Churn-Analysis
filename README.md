# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company using Python. The goal is to identify factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights for customer retention.

## 📁 Project Overview
- Conducted **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization** on telecom customer data.
- Analyzed relationships between churn and demographic, service, and billing features.
- Built clear **visual insights** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Senior citizens and month-to-month contract users show higher churn.
- Customers without add-on services like TechSupport or OnlineSecurity are more likely to leave.
- Electronic check payment users have the highest churn rate.
- Long-tenure customers and those using automatic payments tend to stay longer.

## 📈 Visuals Created
- Countplots for churn across multiple service and demographic categories.
- Stacked bar and pie charts showing churn distribution.
- Histograms for tenure and charges analysis.

## 🧾 Tools Used
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📑 Files in Repository
